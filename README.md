# AsmTinySerial

Serial assembly library for AVR ATtiny

## Description

This serial library is written in assembly and is based on work done by [Ralph Doncaster](http://nerdralph.blogspot.fr/2013/12/writing-avr-assembler-code-with-arduino.html).

With a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) interface it has been written for microcontrollers [Atmel AVR Tiny](http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/avr/tinyavr.aspx).

At the end it has been tested on a [ATtiny85](http://www.atmel.com/devices/attiny85.aspx) and must be at least compatible with ATtinyX5 series.
